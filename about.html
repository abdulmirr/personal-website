            <h1 class="story-title">Hey, I'm Abdul 👋</h1>

            <p class="about-text">I’m 19, from Chicago.</p>
            <p class="about-text">I’m into design, business, and building things.</p>
            <p class="about-text">I previously founded 2 businesses: <a href="http://combatny.com"
                    class="project-link">Combat</a>, a
                clothing brand I started in high school and <a href="http://builtbyabdul.com" class="project-link">Built
                    by Abdul</a>, a cold email agency helping
                businesses grow with AI.</p>
            <p class="about-text">I'm studying Communication at UIUC, but I could care less about that.</p>
            <p class="about-text">In my free time, I like to make videos, read, speed, and lift.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">History</h2>
            <p class="about-text">I’ve been entrepreneurial my whole life. Ever since moving to America at 10, I helped
                my Dad sell socks and TVs in flea markets, ornaments in malls, and books on Amazon. I later moved to
                streetwear, flipping clothes on Grailed until I got banned.</p>
            <p class="about-text">I started my first real company at 15. After teaching myself Photoshop, mass DMing
                every one of my 300 followers on Instagram, and setting up a Shopify site, I launched my clothing brand
                Mir Studio. This project continued until I lost the love for it after 3 years. I dropped 10 pieces and
                made around $25k revenue in total.</p>
            <p class="about-text">In 2024, I moved to New York to study design at Pratt, until I dropped out a semester
                later. During this time, I made videos & turned Mir into <a href="http://combatny.com"
                    class="project-link">Combat</a> with
                my best friend. We made products, designed a magazine, and showcased in a pop-up. Combat’s focus has
                changed since from a clothing brand to a brand providing community/tools for creatives.</p>
            <p class="about-text">Early 2025, I moved back home to Chicago to lock in and start making money. I took a
                break from all social media and cut off friends. I learned about AI & automation and started a new
                agency, <a href="http://builtbyabdul.com" class="project-link">Built by Abdul</a>. I started off with
                general make/n8n automation, then focused in B2B cold email with Clay.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">More about me</h2>
            <ul class="about-list">
                <li class="about-list-item">I love making things. I grew up very creative. I dabbled in video, product
                    design, and content creation. Now I’m learning how to code/build with AI.</li>
                <li class="about-list-item">My heroes growing up were Steve Jobs & Ye. These 2 inspired me to live life
                    differently. I recommend the biography and documentary to everyone.</li>
                <li class="about-list-item">I’m in the pursuit of physical excellence. I love the gym. Bulking until I
                    feel my muscles are big enough, doing Muay Thai on the side.</li>
                <li class="about-list-item">My favorite movies are Nightcrawler, The Social Network and Her.</li>
                <li class="about-list-item">I’m searching for my other half. My ride or die. A curious, kind, fit,
                    gorgeous,
                    smart, funny, warm woman with style.</li>
